I was born in London, England.
As a result I have a lot of family over there and have been fortunate enough to lots of traveling around Europe.
One of my favorite memories was walking along some castle ramparts in Prague with my cousins, looking down on the city as a soft snowfall fell.
It was like stepping back in time, contrasted against a slowly encroaching modernization.
